Will. In 1896, E. Martel discovered the cave where the lake is named after him. Between 1922 and 1935 the cave was conditioned to be able to be visited, with the opening of a new access entrance, with the construction of new paths and stairs ... And, above all, with the placement of Electrical illumination designed by the engineer Mr. Buigas The visit lasts approximately one hour and the route is about 1,200 meters. It includes a concert of classical music and a boat trip on Lake Martel. The temperature in the interior is about 21ÂºC and the humidity of 80%.</h3></div>
